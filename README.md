# EnhancedDamage

This addon makes the damage system in gmod more 'realistic'
If you get shot in the head you die instantly no matter what
If you get shot in the arm the damage is significantly reduced and there is a chance of you dropping your weapon
if you get shot in your hand there is a large chance that you will drop your weapon but the damage is almost non existent
If you get shot in the leg you are slowed down

## Console commands
'''
enhanceddamage_enabled 1/0 for toggling it on an off
